# ordinal-numbers
Program that does the following:
  - prompts the user with "Enter a number from 1 to 20:\n"
  - reads the user's response
  - if the user's response was, say, 10, the program then prints a short message followed by the first 10 ordinal numbers, one      per line, and then terminates
  - if the user enters a number that is outside of the 1..20 range, the program prints an error message and terminates.
