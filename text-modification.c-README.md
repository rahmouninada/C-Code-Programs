# text-modification
Program does the following:
  - continually reads lines of text and prints them with modifications without storing them
      - replaces 'E' or 'e' with '3' ; 'I' or 'i' with '1' ; each 'O' or 'o' by '0'; 'S' or 's' with '5'
      - e.g. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. --> Th3 qu1ck br0wn f0x jump5 0v3r th3 lazy d0g.
  - stops when reads an empty line
