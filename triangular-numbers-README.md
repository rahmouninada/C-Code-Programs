# Comp-411-C-Code
Program that does the following:
  - repeatedly reads an integer in decimal format
  - determines if it is a triangular number or not
  - specifically:
      - prompt user to enter a number (input will be in decimal format, in range of a normal int, or 0 to stop the program)
      - if number entered is a triangular number, the program prints "num is a triangular number"
      - else, prints "num is not triangular, nearest triangular number below _num_is xx"
          - ("xx" is greatest triangular number below "num")
      - repeats, prompting for the next input
      - when user enters a 0, prints "Done" & terminates
