# matrix-multiplication
Program does the following:
  - reads 2 M-matrices
      - first line of input is value of M (integer 1 through 10)
      - next line is MM integers, one per line, for the values of matrix A (in row major order)
      - next line MM integers for values of matrix B 
  - computes their product
      - e.g. A[M][M] x B[M][M] = C[M][M]
  - prints the resulting matrix in matrix format within a width of 6 characters
